# JalRakshak: Smart Community Health Monitoring & Early Warning System

## Overview
JalRakshak (जलरक्षक) is an **AI-powered community health monitoring and early warning system** designed for **rural Northeast India**. It focuses on preventing outbreaks of **water-borne diseases** such as cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, and typhoid by integrating **IoT-based water quality monitoring**, **community health data collection**, and **AI-driven predictive analytics**.

## Problem Statement
Rural communities in Northeast India face repeated challenges of **contaminated water supplies** and **poor sanitation infrastructure**. Early detection of water-borne disease risks is often missed due to lack of continuous monitoring, delayed reporting, and limited healthcare access. JalRakshak aims to **bridge this gap** by providing **low-cost, real-time, and actionable insights** to health workers, NGOs, and government agencies.

## Objectives
- Monitor **water quality parameters** (pH, turbidity, TDS, microbial contamination).
- Collect **community health reports** (fever, diarrhea, dehydration symptoms).
- Use **AI/ML models** to detect outbreak risks and provide early warnings.
- Provide **real-time dashboards** with **map-based risk visualization**.
- Deliver **SMS/IVR alerts** to rural health workers and local communities.

## System Architecture
1. **Data Collection Layer**  
   - IoT sensors in community water sources.  
   - Mobile apps / offline forms for health workers.  

2. **Processing Layer**  
   - Preprocessing of water & health data.  
   - AI model for anomaly & outbreak detection.  

3. **Application Layer**  
   - Web dashboard (risk heatmaps, alerts).  
   - SMS/IVR-based warning system for low-connectivity areas.  

## Key Features
-  **IoT Water Quality Monitoring** – pH, turbidity, TDS, bacterial indicators.  
-  **Community Health Tracking** – symptoms reported by health workers.  
-  **AI-Powered Predictions** – outbreak likelihood detection.  
-  **Rural Connectivity Support** – works with SMS/IVR for low internet zones.  
-  **Interactive Dashboard** – real-time maps of risk areas.  
-  **Low-Cost Deployment** – solar-powered IoT devices, scalable to rural clusters.  

## Target Audience
- Rural healthcare centers & NGOs.  
- Government health departments.  
- Disaster management authorities.  
- Community water management bodies.  

## Impact
- Early detection of outbreaks reduces large-scale health crises.  
- Supports **health workers** with actionable, real-time insights.  
- Reduces **healthcare costs** by preventing late-stage disease spread.  
- Empowers **communities** with safer water and better health awareness.  

## Future Scope
- Integration with **national health records & schemes**.  
- Expansion to monitor **vector-borne diseases** (malaria, dengue).  
- Predictive analytics for **seasonal outbreak patterns**.  
- Multilingual **mobile health apps** for communities.
